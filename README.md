# ACM-Flask-Presentation
Source code used in a presentation to my local ACM Student Chapter on the topic of web server development with Python's Flask framework.

All of these files are designed for demonstration purposes and are not fully-functional applications, nor should they be expected to consider edge cases or detailed security concerns. 
Though the files are primarily intended to complement ones learning via the powerpoint presentation, they can also be used as very basic templates for beginner Flask projects.
